# Hello! I'm Marco

I'm an interdisciplinary professional with interests in **health**, **art**, and the **humanities**, currently exploring the potential of **GitHub** to integrate educational, artistic, and digital projects. I'm in a phase of self-directed learning, combining creativity and technology to create blogs, websites, and interactive experiences.

### About Me

I’m currently working independently on blogs, web pages, and interdisciplinary dissemination projects. At the same time, I’m learning web development, GitHub, HTML, Markdown, and basic programming with the support of artificial intelligence. I’m interested in collaborating on projects related to digital art, education, mental health, and symbolic communication. I’m also seeking guidance on Git, GitHub Actions, JavaScript, and how to structure complex repositories efficiently. You can ask me about philosophy, psychology, symbolism, art, education, and health.

To get in touch, feel free to reach out via [X](https://x.com/vinicio_salto) or soon through my personal blog.

**Fun fact:** I’m building games and symbolic narrative experiences without knowing much code… but I’m learning every day!

- This GitHub repository is created to store and manage my drafts before publishing them on my blogs, as well as to include some innovative proposals developed as tasks to organize my ideas and control various entries.
- Most of my repositories are currently in **Spanish** as part of my learning journey, but I plan to progressively create content in **English** as well.

I do not consider myself a programmer in the strict sense of the word; a programmer is someone who uses their ingenuity to create technology. I would rather consider myself a learner or a companion on this vast technological journey. As a beginner, my goal is to create a space that fosters my learning in areas such as technology, art, experiences, progress, beliefs, and more, always promoting critical, creative, and divergent thinking.

In this context, this repository represents a sample of my work as a creator and professional in the fields of arts, humanities, and health, where I aim to integrate interdisciplinary knowledge and a reflective approach to enrich my practice.

### Language Notice

Most of my repositories are currently in **Spanish** as part of my learning process. Gradually, I will start creating content in **English** to expand collaboration and accessibility.
