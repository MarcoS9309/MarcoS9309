> *i believe in learning as a form of critical and creative resistance.* my goal is to integrate diverse knowledge to generate symbolic, educational, and human impact through digital environments.
> i’m in a phase of **self‑directed learning**: i blend ai, art, and storytelling to create blogs, websites, and small interactive experiences. i use GitHub as a **workbench**, not a perfect showcase. i’m interested in projects on **digital art, education, mental health**, and **symbolic communication**; i’m also seeking practice with **git**, **github actions**, **javascript**, and **repository architecture**.

## quick highlights

* **now**: writing stories/fables, testing minimal web templates, and prototyping llm tools.
* **approach**: small iterations, clear constraints, and honest documentation.
* **values**: critical thinking, ethical ai, accessibility, and kindness.
* **bilingual**: spanish (native) · english (working).

## now

* writing **stories and fables** (with psychology and symbols).
* testing **minimal templates** for static sites.
* integrating **LLMs** (chatbots, prompts, and small utilities).
* exploring **photo/ai** for visual narratives.
* learning **web dev** (HTML, Markdown, JS) and **Git/GitHub** workflows.
* considering **several master’s programs**; the one i’m evaluating is **innovative** (art + education + technology).

## about me

I don’t call myself a “programmer” in the strict sense; today I see myself as a **learner and fellow traveler**. I’m building a space that encourages **critical, creative, and divergent** thinking, bridging arts, humanities, and health. This profile‑repo works as a **studio** where I keep drafts, prototypes, and proposals before publishing them to blogs or sites.
