# Hi, I'm **Marco Vinicio** 

*I build small, human-centered experiments at the edge of **art × AI × education**.*

> *I believe in learning as a form of critical and creative resistance.* My goal is to integrate diverse knowledge to create symbolic, educational, and human impact through digital environments.
> I’m in a phase of **self-directed learning**: I blend AI, art, and storytelling to create blogs, websites, and small interactive experiences. I use GitHub as a **workbench**, not a perfect showcase. I’m interested in projects on **digital art, education, mental health**, and **symbolic communication**; I’m also seeking practice with **Git**, **GitHub Actions**, **JavaScript**, and **repository architecture**.

---

## quick highlights

* **now**: writing stories/fables, testing minimal web templates, and prototyping LLM tools.
* **approach**: small iterations, clear constraints, and honest documentation.
* **values**: critical thinking, ethical AI, accessibility, and kindness.
* **bilingual**: Spanish (native) · English (working).

## now

* Writing **stories and fables** (with psychology and symbols).
* Testing **minimal templates** for static sites.
* Integrating **LLMs** (chatbots, prompts, and small utilities).
* Exploring **photo/AI** for visual narratives.
* Learning **web dev** (HTML, Markdown, JS) and **Git/GitHub** workflows.
* Considering **several master’s programs**; the one I’m evaluating is **innovative** (art + education + technology).

## about me

I don’t call myself a “programmer” in the strict sense; today I see myself as a **learner and fellow traveler**. I’m building a space that encourages **critical, creative, and divergent** thinking, bridging arts, humanities, and health. This profile-repo works as a **studio** where I keep drafts, prototypes, and proposals before publishing them to blogs or sites.
