# Hello! I'm Marco

I'm an interdisciplinary professional with interests in **health**, **art**, and the **humanities**, currently exploring the potential of **GitHub** to integrate educational, artistic, and digital projects. I'm in a phase of self-directed learning, combining creativity and technology to create blogs, websites, and interactive experiences.

### About Me

I’m currently working independently on blogs, web pages, and interdisciplinary dissemination projects. At the same time, I’m learning web development, GitHub, HTML, Markdown, and basic programming with the support of artificial intelligence. I’m interested in collaborating on projects related to digital art, education, mental health, and symbolic communication. I’m also seeking guidance on Git, GitHub Actions, JavaScript, and how to structure complex repositories efficiently. You can ask me about philosophy, psychology, symbolism, art, education, and health.

To get in touch, feel free to reach out via [X](https://x.com/vinicio_salto) or soon through my personal blog.

**Fun fact:** I’m building games and symbolic narrative experiences without knowing much code… but I’m learning every day!

Most of my repositories are currently in **Spanish** as part of my learning journey, but I plan to progressively create content in **English** as well.

### Language Notice

Most of my repositories are currently in **Spanish** as part of my learning process. Gradually, I will start creating content in **English** to expand collaboration and accessibility.

> I believe in learning as a form of critical and creative resistance. My goal is to integrate diverse knowledge to generate symbolic, educational, and human impact through digital environments.
